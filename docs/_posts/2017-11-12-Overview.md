Welcome to the tinyfish project.  The purpose behind tinyfish is to explore the ecosystem of tools and services that surround web apps today.  It all starts with code.  Well, it all starts with a plan but the first tangible milestone is working code.  

We are going to build a tiny web app that is so small even calling it a web app will be generous.  That app will give us a starting point to build up the tools, configurations and services that support even the smallest apps today. This where the ecosystem will start to show itself which is going to be our focus.  

On a side note, I am using this project  to also test out Github pages and attempt some entry front-end work.  Please tell me if I do this wrong and it's all the better if you have suggestions for me.
