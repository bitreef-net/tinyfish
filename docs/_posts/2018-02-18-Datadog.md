Let's start measuring!  In this post we will discuss adding Datadog to TinyFish.  [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) is a tool for monitoring systems and analytics.  It is going to allow us to monitor system performance and resource consumption.  Thanks to the dockerized Datadog agent, adding Datadog was very easy as well but we will get into that later in the post.  

Datadog is an incredible tool and I highly recommend it, however it is arguably overkill for our needs.  Luckily Datadog offers a pretty generous free account so overkill it is.  To implement Datadog I started by moving TinyFish to docker-compose which is easier than it sounds.  Docker-compose is a tool to simplify running multiple containers needed by an application.  To use docker-compose I wrote a docker-compose.yml file which tells docker which containers we want to run.  TinyFish is a very simple application so we will only be running two containers right now, the TinyFish container and the [Datadog agent](https://hub.docker.com/r/datadog/docker-dd-agent/) container.  Once the docker-compose.yml file was written all I had to do was run `docker-compose up` instead of `docker run -p 5000:5000 tinyfish:latest`.  

Datadog offers two containers for it's agent, Debian and Alpine.  I would love to use Alpine for the small footprint but the Alpine version does not support all Datadog's features.  I settled for Debian but will gladly move to Alpine once there is a little more support.  If you want to try out Datadog yourself all you need to do is sign up for an account at Datadog's site to get an API key.  Once you have an API key update the [datadog.env](https://github.com/bitreef-net/tinyfish/blob/d9e774cbe33a1337f20442d0da3c4d6997cf19fa/datadog.env#L1) file with your Datadog API key and run `docker-compose up` and that should be it.  I highly recommend enabling the [Docker integration](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/) in your Datadog account.  All the basic client setup has been done for TinyFish via the docker-compose file.  Don't rely on the TinyFish defaults though, play with the Datadog configuration to find out what is right for you.

So Datadog is great and all, but I understand why most people would not introduce a tool like Datadog this early in a project.  I opted to add Datadog in now it will allow us to measure the impact of future tools and so it is really important to me to add it up front.  Below is what Datadog recorded.  I initially started the containers and then stopped them.  The red arrows point to Datadog trying to make sense of the missing data.  The containers were properly started just after 15:30 and I ran `watch -n 1 curl http://127.0.0.1:5000` to at least have TinyFish show some traffic.  I did stop my watch command briefly which is indicated by the yellow arrows.

So this gives a (very rough) baseline of what to expect.  The next post will be about NGINX and uWSGI.  Both of these are highly recommended to be put in front of a Python application but at what cost to the system?  Since we now have Datadog we will be able to find out.
